# TensorFlow

This documentation needs more input and feeback from your end to help in establsing a better resource, standard procedures for the Students, Professionals, AL & ML aspirants and Entusiasts.

**I have tried to keep the explanation as simple as possible for you, but in case:**
1. If you find any praragraph or technical jargon challenging, please point it out or write to me at sarawalabs@gmail.com with 'Subject: TensorFlow - Recommendations | Suggestions'.
2. If you want to contribute here you can have a 'Subject: TensorFlow - Contributions'

**Before starting let's clear some myths:**
1. There are number of AI & ML tools and frameworks, but if you good in one of the prgramming languages and strong in mathematics, you can write your own ML code from the scratch.
2. Libs, Frameworks and tools are meant to reduce the effort of writing and managing the extra code, helps in structing larger projects, provides proven and robust integration of thrid party tools, libs and extensions, helps with lints, suggestions etc.
3. There no age or time to learn, human brain is byond limitations and capabilities, may be this story can inspire you before going through the video. The incredible story of the boy who invented Braille https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o9BOQ6IpTSE&ab_channel=BBCIdeas) and once you look one of your famour genius and inventer video here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FeUA-0G1p5k&ab_channel=Newsthink, you will understand the impact or impression of the first video and many more of inspiring video.

**About this repo:**
1. Framework used TensorFlow, however if any modern programming language and Advance Mathematics like Calculus, Statistics and Probability is your Forte, you can use any Framework or libs.
2. IDE tool used is VS Code but you can run the same in Jupyter Notebook as well.
3. Programing langauge used in Python, but you can write the code in your comforatable langauages.
4. Windows OS used.

**Pre-requisites:**
1. Installing python: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Intall VS Code referring the link: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
3. Setting up Python Environment on VS Cdoe: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/environments
4. You can ignore it, unless if you want to use Jupyter Notebook in VS Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support-py

**Environment Setup: **
Note**: You can skip this part if there's already and environment setup 
If the above steps are challenging for you:
1. Inatall anaconda.

conda install tensoflow
conda create --name tf tensorflow-gpu
conda create --name tf_cpu
conda activate tf_cpu
conda activate tf_cpu

2. conda install pip
pip3 install --upgrade https://storage.googleapis.com/tensorflow/mac/cpu/tensorflow-1.0.0-py3-none-any.whl
3. install vs code

4. install python extension
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=donjayamanne.python-extension-pack

5. ctrl+shift+P select python interpreter.

6. type jupyter: create new project

7. install ipykernel (give permission to the conda env folder).
